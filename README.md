To start the game, run the SWE_CAP3_02230312.py file. You will be presented with a main menu where you can select the desired difficulty level. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake's movement. The game will end if the snake collides with itself or the boundary walls.

Gameplay
Guide the snake through the maze to eat food pellets and grow longer.
Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the maze walls.
As the snake eats more food, it will grow longer, making it more challenging to navigate the maze.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Your score is displayed on the screen, and the high score is saved for each difficulty level.
